# Mp3 Renamer

A simple Windows application to rename MP3 files in a folder based on their ID3 tags.

It automatically renames files to the following format: Artist - Title.mp3

### How it works
1. Select a folder containing MP3 files.
2. Automatically rename all files that have valid Artist and Title ID3 tags.
3. Skips files with missing or invalid tags.
4. Shows a success message with the number of files renamed.
